                    <p>My name is Veronica Lozada, I'm 22 years old. I'm from Caracas, Venezuela and I recently moved to Atlanta
                        looking for personal and professional growth and to have new experiences in life. I just graduated
                        from Industrial Engineering at the Universidad Simon Bolivar located in Caracas. I had the opportunity
                        to live in Barcelona for a year as an exchange student and has been one of the best experiences in
                        my life, getting to know people from all over the world and to experience a different culture than
                        mine. I love to travel and meet new places everytime I can. </p>
